## Background {#background}

<details>
  <summary>Show</summary>

The province maintains a network of groundwater observation wells to monitor water levels in priority aquifers. These observation wells (OW) record water level fluctuations which allow for improved understanding of how aquifers respond to changes in climate, precipitation, and effects from pumping. Many of the observation wells are equipped with satellite telemetry to provide real time information on water levels.

The following summaries compare recent groundwater levels to historical continuous daily records to determine percentile classes, with a minimum of `r years_min` years of data. A percentile is on a scale of 100 and indicates the percent of a distribution that is equal to or below it. For example, a groundwater level at the 10th percentile is equal to or greater than 10% of the water level values recorded on this day of the year during all years of data.

In general, a groundwater level value that is:

* the highest ever measured for the day of year is considered <span style="color: black;">**High**</span>
* greater than the 90th percentile is considered <span style="color: blue;">**Much Above Normal**</span>
* between 75th percentile and 90th percentile is considered <span style="color: cyan;">**Above Normal**</span>
* between 25th and 75th percentiles is considered <span style="color: green;">**Normal**</span>
* less than the 25 percentile is considered <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**Below Normal**</span>
* less than 10 percentile is considered <span style="color: #800000;">**Much Below Normal**</span>
* the lowest ever measured for the day of year is considered <span style="color: red;">**Low**</span>.

## Historical Water Level Plots {#plots .tabset} 

### **Description**

Annual hydrographs and historical records for the observation wells summarized above can be found in this section.

Current conditions for provincial groundwater observation wells can be accessed any time through the [Groundwater Level Data Interactive Map]( https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/water/groundwater-wells-aquifers/groundwater-observation-well-network/groundwater-level-data-interactive-map).

Note: ‘Working’ data are preliminary and have not yet been finalized as ‘Approved’ data with approved corrections and data grades for quality assurance. Quality assurance procedures may result in differences between what is displayed as 'Working' and what will become the official record.

```{r plots, results = "asis", fig.asp = 0.9, fig.width = 10}
latest_date <- w_dates %>% 
  group_by(ow) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Value)) %>%
  filter(Date == max(Date)) %>%
  filter(CurrentYear) #Keep only ones that are in Table 4?

w_meta <- w_dates %>%
  well_meta()
for(ow in sort(ows)) {
  w_meta %>%
    filter(.data$ow %in% !!ow) %>%
    select("ow", "region", "location", "type", "hydraulic_connectivity") %>%
    distinct() %>%
    mutate(ow = ow_fish(ow)) %>%
    glue_data("\n\n\n### {ow}\n\n",
              "[Map](#map)<br>",
              "<strong>Region:</strong> {region}<br>\n",

              "<strong>Aquifer type:</strong> {type}<br>\n",

  date <- filter(latest_date, ow == !!ow)
  
  g1 <- well_plot_perc(full, hist, date, years_min)
  g2 <- well_plot_hist(full, hist)
  
  g <- g1 / g2
  print(g)
}
```


## Appendices {#appendices .tabset}

### A - Dates

If data isn't available for an exact reporting date, dates up to `r n_days` days
before and `r n_days` days after the report date are examined for non-missing data. 
Thus, an alternative date is chosen within a 
`r n_days * 2 + 1`-day window, centred on the reporting date.

If there are multiple dates with data, the dates are ranked based on their historical data
quality (for calculating percentiles) and their nearness to the original date indicated.
The top date is then chosen for that well and that reporting date. 

This table lists the original reporting dates, and the actual dates used for each 
observation well. 

```{r appendix}
a <- appendix_dates(w_dates)
index <- table(a$region)

tbl_a <- a %>%
  select(- "region") %>%
  kable(format = "html", align = "llccccc", escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = "hover", full_width = FALSE, 
    htmltable_class = "bcgwl-table lightable-classic lightable-hover") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>%
  add_header_above(c("", "", "", "Report Dates vs. Measurement dates" = 4), 
                   bold = TRUE)

#if(any(a == ""  | is.na(a))) tbl_a <- kableExtra::footnote(tbl_a, general = glue("&bull; {note_no_data}"), escape = FALSE)

tbl_a

```


### B - Calculations

#### General details
- Water year starts in October
- Well measurements are all in Depth Below Ground in metres
- Current Water Year plots show data for the most recent water year with at least
  1 week of data (7 days).

#### Percentiles
- Percentiles are calculated individually for each day of the year for each well
- 366 day in leap years is omitted
- "Good" quality data have 'Approved' historical values for >= `r years_min` years
- "Poor" quality data have 'Approved' historical values for < `r years_min` 
  years and are not used (percentiles for that well on that day of the year are
  missing from the figures and tables).
